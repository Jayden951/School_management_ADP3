Q10

A group discussion was held and the main points that were raised were:

• The task was difficult, and it was not as easy working in a group, but it was helpful to work in one. The assignment was also a learning curve.
• The assignment was tricky because of how interlinked each class was. There were shared attributes in most classes which really tested our communication skills and patience. Our group did a fairly good job with the assignment but one thing we all need to learn is that everyone codes differently and at their own pace, but we also need to take the time and due date into consideration.
• We are all still learning each other’s way of working, but overall, it was agreed we did well as a group.
• There were some issues with Git during the assignment that did make us have to take a step back and solve that first before we could go on with the assignment. The group communication was really well; we were able to ask for help from each other and voice our opinions and concerns to each other.
• The way the UML is set up, some entities have to be done first before you can move on to the next. This can cause problems for some students as they have to wait for someone else to complete their entity first before they can start working. The factory and the factory testing have the same problem.
• The attributes being linked to other entities made it hard for us to do as a group, so a solution to that problem would have to be for the entities not to be attached to others.
